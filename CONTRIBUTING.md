# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute! This file describes simple steps to get started, please contribute, this code is bad, and I am a bad programmer, this code is in the minimum 50% generated by IA, so please contribute!

Quick steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/xyz` or `fix/bug-small`.
3. Make small changes and commit frequently.
4. Run tests and add new tests when possible.
5. Open a Pull Request explaining what changed and why.

Development environment:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd universe-engine
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to run the game locally:

```bash
python run.py
```

Run tests (if present):

```bash
pytest -q
```

Good first tasks:

- Add docstrings and simple type hints in `src/rendering/render.py`.
- Improve `src/utils/config.py` with validations and commented defaults.
- Add simple tests for `src/utils/save_manager.py` (save, list, load).
- Update `README.md` with usage examples (we started this already).

Style and review tips:

- Keep changes small and focused — this makes review easier.
- Run the code locally before opening a PR to ensure nothing breaks.
- Use clear commit messages: `feat: add X` or `fix: correct Y`.

If you need help: open an issue describing what you want to do — a maintainer can guide or assign the task.

Thanks for contributing!
